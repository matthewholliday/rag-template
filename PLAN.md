# Solution Plan: Status Endpoint Implementation

## Overview
Implement a RESTful health check endpoint (GET /status) that returns the current operational status of the API along with a server timestamp. This endpoint will provide a simple way to verify that the API is running and responsive.

## Requirements
- **Endpoint**: GET /status
- **Response Format**: JSON
- **Response Fields**:
  - `status` (string, required): API operational status (example: "ok")
  - `timestamp` (string, optional): Current server time in ISO 8601 format (example: "2025-10-16T12:00:00Z")
- **HTTP Status Code**: 200 for successful health check
- **Technology**: Python-based web framework (FastAPI recommended for modern async support and OpenAPI integration)

## Approach
We will use FastAPI as the web framework due to its:
- Native OpenAPI specification support (aligns with existing api-spec.yml)
- Built-in data validation using Pydantic
- Modern async/await support
- Excellent performance and type hint integration
- Simple deployment and testing capabilities

The implementation will follow functional programming principles with pure functions for core logic and side effects isolated at API boundaries.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. **Initialize Python project structure**
   - Rationale: Establish organized codebase foundation
   - Dependencies: None
   - Validation: Directory structure exists with proper separation of concerns
   - Actions:
     - Create `src/` directory for application code
     - Create `tests/` directory for test files
     - Create `pyproject.toml` for dependency management

2. **Configure dependencies**
   - Rationale: Install required libraries for web framework and testing
   - Dependencies: Step 1 completed
   - Validation: Dependencies can be installed without errors
   - Actions:
     - Add FastAPI and Uvicorn to pyproject.toml
     - Add pytest and httpx for testing
     - Add python-dateutil for ISO 8601 timestamp handling

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
3. **Implement timestamp generation function (pure)**
   - Rationale: Create reusable, testable function for ISO 8601 timestamps
   - Dependencies: Step 2 completed
   - Validation: Function returns correctly formatted ISO 8601 strings
   - Actions:
     - Create `src/time_utils.py` with `get_current_timestamp()` function
     - Function should be pure (deterministic for testing via dependency injection)
     - Return format: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" in UTC

4. **Implement status response model**
   - Rationale: Define structured response schema using Pydantic
   - Dependencies: Step 2 completed
   - Validation: Model validates correct data and rejects invalid data
   - Actions:
     - Create `src/models.py` with `StatusResponse` Pydantic model
     - Define `status` as required string field
     - Define `timestamp` as optional string field with ISO 8601 format

5. **Implement status endpoint handler**
   - Rationale: Create the main endpoint logic
   - Dependencies: Steps 3 and 4 completed
   - Validation: Endpoint returns correct response structure
   - Actions:
     - Create `src/main.py` with FastAPI application
     - Implement GET /status endpoint
     - Endpoint returns StatusResponse with status="ok" and current timestamp

### Phase 3: Testing
6. **Create unit tests for timestamp function**
   - Rationale: Verify timestamp generation logic
   - Dependencies: Step 3 completed
   - Validation: Tests pass and cover happy path and edge cases
   - Actions:
     - Create `tests/test_time_utils.py`
     - Test valid ISO 8601 format
     - Test UTC timezone

7. **Create unit tests for status response model**
   - Rationale: Verify Pydantic model validation
   - Dependencies: Step 4 completed
   - Validation: Tests pass for valid and invalid data
   - Actions:
     - Create `tests/test_models.py`
     - Test successful model creation with required fields
     - Test model creation with optional timestamp
     - Test JSON serialization

8. **Create integration tests for status endpoint**
   - Rationale: Verify end-to-end endpoint functionality
   - Dependencies: Step 5 completed
   - Validation: Tests pass and verify HTTP 200, JSON structure, and field values
   - Actions:
     - Create `tests/test_main.py`
     - Test GET /status returns 200 status code
     - Test response contains "status" field with value "ok"
     - Test response contains "timestamp" field with valid ISO 8601 format
     - Test response content-type is application/json

### Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment
9. **Add API documentation**
   - Rationale: Ensure endpoint is properly documented
   - Dependencies: Step 5 completed
   - Validation: FastAPI auto-generated docs display endpoint correctly
   - Actions:
     - Add description and tags to endpoint
     - Verify OpenAPI schema matches api-spec.yml requirements

10. **Create startup script**
    - Rationale: Simplify running the application
    - Dependencies: All implementation completed
    - Validation: Application starts without errors
    - Actions:
      - Document how to run: `uvicorn src.main:app --reload`
      - Add to README or pyproject.toml scripts

## Risk Considerations
- **Timezone consistency**: Mitigated by always using UTC for timestamps
- **Timestamp format variations**: Mitigated by using standard datetime.isoformat() with explicit UTC
- **Framework version compatibility**: Mitigated by pinning FastAPI and Uvicorn versions in pyproject.toml
- **Test isolation**: Mitigated by using FastAPI TestClient for deterministic testing

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions (timestamp generation, model validation) in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test the complete endpoint using FastAPI's TestClient
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 100% coverage of core business logic
- **Test Framework**: pytest with httpx for async testing support
- **Validation**: All tests must pass before considering implementation complete

## Success Criteria
- GET /status endpoint responds with HTTP 200
- Response contains required "status" field with value "ok"
- Response contains "timestamp" field in valid ISO 8601 format
- All unit and integration tests pass
- Code follows functional programming principles (pure functions, side effects at boundaries)
- Response matches OpenAPI specification in api-spec.yml
- Application can be started and endpoint is accessible via HTTP
